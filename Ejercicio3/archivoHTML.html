For water sampling protocols see the Arctic LTER Land-Water group protocol book accessible from the Land-Water mainpage on the Arctic LTER web page or at http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gwk and clicking on the protocol link at the bottom of the page.  Specific methodologies are described in the protocol book listed above and a general description is provided below.

General analyses:  In general water samples from soils, streams, and lakes are filtered in the field and kept cold and dark or preserved until analysis.  Dissolved inorganic nutrients (NH4 and PO4) were analyzed by wet chemistry techniques at Toolik Field Station usually within 24 hours of sampling.  Dissolved gases CO2 and CH4 were determined using a syringe equilibration method and analyzed at Toolik Field Station on a gas chromatograph.  DOC, TDN, TDP, particulate C, N, and P, and dissolved ions were brought back to the University of Michigan for analysis.  DOC is analyzed on a Shimadzu TOC-5000 or a TOC-V.  Particulate Carbon and Nitrogen on a Perkin Elmer CHN 2400, TDN is analyzed on a Shimadzu TOC-5000 or TOC-V or using a persulfate digestion.  TDP and NO3 are analyzed on an OI Alpkem autoanalyzer, ions on a Dionex ion chromatograph, and cations on an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES Perkin Elmer Optima 4300 or 8000).  Alkalinity samples were run on a Radiometer autotitrator.

For all analyses, sample values that were less than zero were assigned a value of zero.  See specific protocols for limits of detection.  Missing values (not sampled or analyzed) are represented by a period " . " in the dataset.

		<li>para: The arctic landscape interacts with the global and regional climate by exchanging carbon dioxide, methane, water, and energy with the atmosphere. Understanding how these exchanges are regulated and how they change is a key goal of the US Study of Environmental Arctic Change and the NSF Arctic Observatory Network. The first goal of this work is year round monitoring of carbon, water, and energy balance at two arctic sites, Imnavait Creek in Alaska and Cherskii in Siberia. The work will be a collaboration among researchers from the Marine Biological Laboratory, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Northeast Science Station, Russia, and the University of Michigan. The second goal is the development of these two sites as ?Flagship? observatories for research on arctic lands and freshwaters. The main task here is to integrate the new carbon, water, and energy balance data with the already large, diverse, and growing data bases from other research done at these sites. A third aim is to promote PanArctic comparisons and development of PanArctic data bases.</li>
		<li>para: Broader impacts include contributions to education, including underrepresented groups, through participation in the Logan Science Journalism program, the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research Schoolyard program, and outreach to Native Alaskan communities. Research and education infrastructure will be enhanced by making the data bases available online. Benefits to society include improved understanding of the impacts of climate change, especially in Alaska where the local residents are closely tied to the land through traditional, subsistence lifestyles.</li>

		<li>geographicDescription: The AON research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities.</li>
